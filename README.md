# ⛑️ Smart Mining Helmet with Safety Sensors

This project involves the development of a **smart mining helmet** equipped with various sensors and communication modules to ensure the safety of miners by monitoring environmental conditions and providing real-time alerts.

## 📦 Components

### 1. 🔥 MQ-2 Gas Sensor
- The **MQ-2** sensor detects various flammable gases, such as smoke, LPG, and methane, at low concentrations, making it ideal for monitoring air quality in mining environments.

### 2. 🌡️ DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
- The **DHT11** sensor provides reliable measurements of temperature and humidity. It outputs digital data, making it easy to monitor the surrounding air conditions.

### 3. 📺 LCD Screen
- A **Liquid Crystal Display (LCD)** screen is used to display critical information, including air quality, temperature, humidity, and system status, ensuring the user can easily access essential data.

### 4. 📡 ESP8266 Microcontroller
- The **ESP8266** is a multifunctional microcontroller that provides Wi-Fi connectivity, enabling the helmet to be integrated into IoT systems for real-time data transmission and remote monitoring.

### 5. 🔗 I2C Interface
- The **I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)** protocol allows efficient communication between multiple components, such as the sensors and LCD, using a two-wire interface.

### 6. 🔋 Power Supply Board
- This board is responsible for managing, distributing, and regulating power across the helmet’s electronic components, ensuring stable operation.

### 7. 🚨 Buzzer
- An audible alarm **buzzer** is integrated into the helmet to alert the wearer of dangerous conditions, such as high gas concentrations or extreme temperatures.

### 8. 🆘 SOS Button
- The **SOS button** allows the user to send an instant distress signal in case of emergencies, providing an additional layer of safety.
