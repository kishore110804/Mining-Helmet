Mining Helmet with Integrated Safety Sensors, 
This project involves the development of a smart mining helmet equipped with various sensors and communication modules to ensure the safety of miners by monitoring environmental conditions and providing real-time alerts.

Components
MQ-2 Gas Sensor

The MQ-2 sensor detects various flammable gases, such as smoke, LPG, and methane, at low concentrations, making it ideal for monitoring air quality in mining environments.
DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor

The DHT11 sensor provides reliable measurements of temperature and humidity. It outputs digital data, making it easy to monitor the surrounding air conditions.
LCD Screen

A Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) screen is used to display critical information, including air quality, temperature, humidity, and system status, ensuring the user can easily access essential data.
ESP8266 Microcontroller

The ESP8266 is a multifunctional microcontroller that provides Wi-Fi connectivity, enabling the helmet to be integrated into IoT systems for real-time data transmission and remote monitoring.
I2C Interface

The I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) protocol allows efficient communication between multiple components, such as the sensors and LCD, using a two-wire interface.
Power Supply Board

This board is responsible for managing, distributing, and regulating power across the helmetâ€™s electronic components, ensuring stable operation.
Buzzer

An audible alarm buzzer is integrated into the helmet to alert the wearer of dangerous conditions, such as high gas concentrations or extreme temperatures.
SOS Button

The SOS button allows the user to send an instant distress signal in case of emergencies, providing an additional layer of safety.
